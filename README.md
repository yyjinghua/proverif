# ProVerif
 ProVerif is a symbol-based automated formal analysis tool that supports multiple security attributes, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and fairness, and can handle complex protocols such as multi-party agreements and key agreement agreements. By automatically deriving information such as security attributes and attack models of security protocols, it can infer the possibility of a certain event on the basis of specific rules and detect possible security vulnerabilities in the protocol to verify the confidentiality of the protocol. . When using the  ProVerif tool to verify a cryptographic protocol, if there is a security problem in the protocol,  ProVerif will generate a corresponding attack sequence. At the same time, it supports unlimited rounds of protocol sessions and unlimited message space, which can avoid the problem of state space explosion. for more studies and acccess to the ProVerif binaries, you can visit [this](https://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/personal/bblanche/proverif/).
